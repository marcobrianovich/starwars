### Scene 1: Time to make a stand

In the opening scene, the PCs are introduced to their characters and the campaign setting. They learn that the First Order deployed two cruisers in the strategically important Dajahn system. The capital city of Dajahn is both a major trade hub and is Sector 17's largest industrial centre, with droid and armament factories and a countless chemical processing plants.

The first order intend to turn Dajahn's output towards their own war effort. To this end they are moving in large numbers of troops for an eventual full occupation. For now, the First Order is stretched thin, leaving room for those who would make a stand and resist their oppression.

The PCs are at their favourite drinking hole, Glockan's Place. More a spice coffee shop than a cantina. Glockan is perminantly situated on a large pedistal behind the bar. He's an Iphibbian,  whose bulky hair barrel-shapped body houses a surprisingly friendly looking face surrounded by an array of 8 long tenticles which he uses to simultaneously serve spice coffees, clean cups and dispense sweet snacks. Glockan in unable to speak directly in standard but uses a protocol droid called PD-8 to converse with customers. 

Glockan has two friends who are perminantly situated at his shop, Spinndoo Slannk is a Sulustian technicial who keeps the spice coffee and food vending machines in good working order. He is also a talented eaves dropper who routinely monitors all traffic going through the starport. Glockan's other friend is Trish Vindaar, a retired Bacta Tanker pilot and an old frienemy of Lonn's. Since Trish retired, she and Lonn have been getting on much better.
