### Scene 1: Time to make a stand

In the opening scene, the PCs are introduced to their characters and the campaign setting. They learn that the First Order deployed two cruisers in the strategically important Dajahn system. Gamba Jahn, the capital city of Dajahn is both a major trade hub and is Sector 17's largest industrial centre, with droid and armament factories and a countless chemical processing plants.

The first order intend to turn Dajahn's output towards their own war effort. To this end they are moving in large numbers of troops for an eventual full occupation. For now, the First Order is stretched thin, leaving room for those who would make a stand and resist their oppression.

The PCs are at their favourite drinking hole, Glockan's Place. More a spice coffee shop than a cantina. Glockan is perminantly situated on a large pedistal behind the bar. He's an Iphibbian,  whose bulky hair covered barrel-shapped body houses a surprisingly friendly looking face surrounded by an array of 8 long tenticles which he uses to simultaneously serve spice coffees, clean cups and dispense sweet snacks. Glockan in unable to speak directly in standard but uses a protocol droid called PD-8 to converse with customers. 

Glockan has two friends who are perminantly situated at his shop, Spinndoo Slannk is a Sulustian technicial who keeps the spice coffee and food vending machines in good working order. He is also a talented eaves dropper who routinely monitors all traffic going through the starport. Glockan's other friend is Trish Vindaar, a retired Bacta Tanker pilot and an old frienemy of Lonn's. Since Trish retired, she and Lonn have been getting on much better.

The scene tells of the PCs decission to make a stand against the First Order, to join the resistence if they can. They conflide in Glockan, who they have known for years and completely trust. In turn, Glockan reveals that his technician, Spinndoo has been decrypting and listening in on First Order transmissions. He's heard something that is very concerning, the first order have done a sweep of local communities, looking for children between 5-10, taking them into custody for housing in various education camps, however, Spinndoo has discovered that these children, who are currently housed at a warehouse near the star port are, in two days, going to be transported to a First Order indoctination centre where Storm Trooper training will begin. Those children who do not have suitble qualities for training as troopers will end up in work camps for the rest of their lives. This cannot be allowed, those children must be rescued and taken to safety.

As the First Order is stretched for resources, they have sactioned the transportation of the children to a slaver called Mansar Dred. Spinndoo has tracked down the location of Dred, who is spending time at his favourite spar in the mountains overlooking Dajhan City. It might be possible to go to the spar and steal Dred's First Order landing FOB, which would allow the PC's to land at the First Order camp, and, pretending ot be Mansar Dred, take the children away.

Scene Two: Spar House Rock

The PCs travel to the exclusive Spar Club where they must sneak in and steal Mansar Dred's First Order landing FOB, a small token that will identify the PCs ship as one working on behalf of the First Order. The Spar, it turns out is the headquarters for a local crime boss -- complicating the mission.

During the mission the PCs learn that Mansar Dred has betrayed the Crime Boss. Dropping the evidence in the hands of the Crime boss allows the PCs the leave with Mansar's fob, while Mansar is dragged into the gyser caverns, as a prisoner of the crime boss.


Scene Three: The big rescue

Armed with the First Order Fob, the PCs can now travel to the First Order holding facility to pick up the children.

Scene Four: Things go south

As the rescue goes on, another ship arrives carrying an escaped Mansar Dred who protests that he is Mansar Dred and that his ID was stolen. Things get fraught, do the PCs continue to claim the identity?

...Possibly Spinndoo Slannk sends a transmission to the base alerting them to the presence of a conman who has been trying to pass himself off as the slaver Mansar Dred. This muddies the water enough for suspicion to fall on Dred, giving the PCs a chance to make a quick exit. 

Scene Five: Escape


Scene Six: Safe and Sound
