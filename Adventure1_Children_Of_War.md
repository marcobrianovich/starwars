## Children of War

A Star Wars Roleplaying Game Adventure set in the Resistance Era.

### Introduction

In the days and weeks after the destruction of Hosnian Prime, the First Order's subjugation fleet spreads across the galaxy, with countless warships taking up position in key star systems. Two cruisers have taken up position in the strategically important Dajahn system, which is the current base of operation for the player characters (PCs).

Together, the PCs have decided that they can no longer sit back and watch the galaxy fall to the First Order. But how to respond? What to do, where to go? The obvious thing to do is to join the Resistance, but you can't just sign up, its a secret organisation, afterall. So, to start the PCs must find a way to resist on their own.

### Adventure Synopis

It's time to make your stand against the First Order, but what can a washed-up Bacta tanker pilot and his motley group of friends do against an unstoppable military machine? Glokan, the PCs friend and proprietor of a spice-coffee bar, located at the cheaper end of the star port, has an idea.

Glokan's Sullustan coffee-machine repair engineer, Reeba Nannab is also an habitual eaves-dropper who has been decrypting and monitoring much of the First Order's comms traffic. She was shocked to learn that the First Order has already swept through the communities surrounding the star port, picking up children and transporting them to a refugee camp located in one of the space ports industrial dock. These children are not being looked after, they will soon be transported off-world, destined to enter Stormtrooper training or enter a life of slavery in a First Order work camp. This can't be allowed to happen! The PCs must somehow rescue the children.

The PCs learn additional facts, the First Order forces are stretched, so they have been forced to hire a slaver called Mansar Dred, who is scheduled to pick up the children in three days and transport them to the First Order indoctrination camp on Taxa Mordel. Apparently, Dred is already on Dajahn, resting at the Reaba-Dajahn exclusive mountain spar. It should be possible for the PCs to sneak into the Spar and steal Dred's First Order Sanction Fob, a small metallic token that can be used by the PCs to pretend to be Dred, allowing them to pick up the children and whisk them to safety.

The PCs sneak into Reaba-Dajahn Spar, they have been encouraged to go in disguise with minimum weapons. On arrival they find that the Spar is under heavy attack from a combination of criminal gang members and First Order troopers -- they quickly learn that Golden Fang, the biggest criminal gang operating on Dejahn has just made a pact with the First Order, to ensure that the planet's criminals don't side against the First Order. In return, the First Order is supporting the Golden Fang's grand take-over. Apparently, the Spar was the headquarters of a smaller criminal gang.

The PCs must work their way to Dred's chalet, while avoiding conflict with any number of hostiles. The good news is that given the PCs are not the target of any of the attackers or defenders, if they stay out of the fight, they won't be targetted directly.

The PCs should be able to work their way to the small chalet currently occupied by Mansar Dred. They find the chalet is very badly damaged, possibly hit by a Tie-bomber strike that started the attack. It looks like Dred was killed, although, in fact it is not Dred but his manservant whose body the PCs find. However, the PCs do recover the First Order Sanction Fob - that will allow them to take on the identity of the slaver.

The second act begins with the PCs getting a map of the First Order refugee camp which they will use to make a plan for picking up the children. How this act proceeds is completely dependent on what the PCs intend to do. However, things complicate when a small shuttle arrives, delivering the very much alive Mansar Dred...

The PCs will need to think quickly as just fighting their way out of the situation is very dangerous. They can get Glockan's tech to send an alert to the base, warning that an escaped patient is attempting to pass himself off as the ruthless slave trader, Mansar Dred. If played well, Mansar is knocked out and dragged to a mobile prison cell. If the PCs don't do such a great job of the deception, the incident throws everything into confusion enought to allow an attempted escape.

In the third act the PC's ship is making a run to jump to a safe system - Trillia, only a TIE fighter patrol is rushing to interdict them. There is no way the PCs ship can fight off 6 TIE fighters. The PCs feel a lot of pressure, making a run with a ship full of children isn't right, even though the PCs may face execution, it may be better to surrender.

At that moment, a small group of resistance X-Wings, lead by Bella Kwyn arrives at the scene and begin to engage the TIE fighters, Bella introduces herself and tells the PCs to travel to a deepspace randezvous, where a resistance transporter will take the chidren to safety.

The adventure ends as the children are passed on to the resistance transporter "Blue Moonbeam". A Resistance contact thanks the PCs for coming to the children's aide, and if they are interested in joining the resistance, report to Takodana, Nymeve Lake. There's something we need to recover from the ruins of Maz Kanata's castle...


### Getting Started

You know the drill, gather the dice, gurd your loins, load your blaster, its time for adventure, in the time of the fall of the new republic. Dark rumours are spreading, that tell of the absolute destruction of the resistance fleet. There's no time to mourn its loss, anyone who wants freedom from First Order oppression needs to get moving.

### Act 1:  Making a stand

#### Scene 1: Resistance starts with a spice coffee

In this opening scene, the PCs are introduced to their characters and the campaign setting. They learn that the First Order deployed two cruisers in the strategically important Dajahn system. Gamba Jahn, the capital city of Dajahn is both a major trade hub and is Sector 17's largest industrial centre, with droid and armament factories and a countless chemical processing plants.

The first order intend to turn Dajahn's output towards their own war effort. To this end they are moving in large numbers of troops for an eventual full occupation. For now, the First Order is stretched thin, leaving room for those who would make a stand and resist.

The PCs are at their favourite drinking hole, Glockan's Place. More a spice coffee shop than a cantina. Glockan is perminantly situated on a large pedistal behind the bar. He's an Iphibbian,  whose bulky, hair-covered barrel-shapped body houses a surprisingly friendly looking face surrounded by an array of 8 long tenticles which he uses to simultaneously serve spice coffees, clean cups and dispense sweet snacks. Glockan can't speak Galactic Basic directly, but wears a sort of necklace that sports the head of a protocol droid called PD-8, who happily helps Glockan converse with customers.

> Life in this galaxy is not easy. You've all had to work hard. Lonn has struggled to win contracts for his banged-up Bacta tanker. Ex-storm trooper and retired bounty hunter, Nal, Lonn's oldest friend takes care of security, but every day things get more dangerous. Their companion, ex-battle droid BD-71 works its magic to keep their ship flying but suddenly independent ships are starting to feel the burdon of extra red tape. Very soon it may be impossible to fly unless under the control of the First Order. And finally, Sarlee, the mysterious young teenager, and would-be stowaway, who everyone suspects of harbouring Force powers, she faces more dangers than anyone as the First Order actively hunts down anyone with Force sensitivity. 
>
> So, the time has come to take action. You all agree that its no longer enough to stand on the sidelines and hope the First Order will give up it's ambitions to take control of the whole galaxy. The New Republic has fallen, the first Order's subjugation fleet is now moving through the free systems, taking control. Thankfully General Leia Organa's resistance forces where able to destroy the First Order's super weapon, the so-called Star Killer Base, but the First Order retalliation was swift and devastating - last anyone heard the Resistance fleet was all but destroyed.
> It seems that if you want the First Order defeated, you're going to have to do it yourselves. To this end, you are sitting at the bar in Glockan's, a spice-coffee bar located at the cheaper end of the star port. Glockan is an old friend and confidant who you have asked for help.

Glockan has two friends who are perminantly situated at his coffee-bar, Reeba Nannab, a Sulustian technicial who keeps the spice coffee and food vending machines in good working order. She is also a talented eavesdropper who routinely monitors all traffic going through the starport. Glockan's other friend is Trish Vindaar, a retired Bacta Tanker pilot and an old frienemy of Lonn's. Since Trish retired, she and Lonn have been getting on much better.

The scene tells of the PCs decission to make a stand against the First Order, to join the resistence if they can. They confide in Glockan, who they have known for years and completely trust. In turn, Glockan reveals that his technician, Reeba has been decrypting and listening in on First Order transmissions. He's heard something that is very concerning, the first order have done a sweep of local communities, looking for children between 5-10, taking them into custody for housing in various education camps, however, Reeba has discovered that these children, who are currently housed at a warehouse near the star port are, in two days, going to be transported to a First Order indoctination centre where Storm Trooper training will begin. Those children who do not have suitble qualities for training as troopers will end up in work camps for the rest of their lives. This cannot be allowed, those children must be rescued and taken to safety.

As the First Order is stretched for resources, they have sactioned the transportation of the children to a slaver called Mansar Dred. Reeba has tracked down the location of Dred, who is spending time at his favourite spar in the mountains overlooking Dajhan City. It might be possible to go to the spar and steal Dred's First Order landing FOB, which would allow the PC's to land at the First Order camp, and, pretending ot be Mansar Dred, take the children away.

> **Lonn:** I've been thinking of joining the fight for a while, but I didn't want to put any of you in more danger. \
> **Nal:** I eat danger for breakfast. In fact I'm not happy unless I get double-helpings. \
> **BD-71:** Nal, this is the First Order we're going up against. This is breakfast, snacks, lunch, more snacks and dinner - ALL OF IT DEADLY DANGEROUS!!! \
> **Saahlee:** I've been running scared my entire life. I want to fight back! I know I'm not a warrior but I can do my part. Maybe a small part. \
> **Glockan:** HHAAA BAAAA GA BE GA BA BAH UPATA \
> **PD-8 (Glockan's translater):** Glockan says 'My friends, Start with a small act of resistance.' \
> **Glockan:** (SHOUTS) REEBA SHAAA BA HA HA BA GAMBAMA. \
> Glockan's Sulustan technician peers out of a small hatch, apparently secretly listening to your entire conversation. \
> **Reeba:** I think I know what you should do. 

Reeba explains that, when not maintaining Glockan's spice coffee machines to the highest operating standards, she is fond of listening in to Star Port traffic. She wanted to fly amonst the stars, listening to ship talk was as close as she ever got, but she got very good at hacking into communication hubs. Since the arrival of the First Order, Reeba has been employing her team of customised astromech's to crack the First Order's encryption, which she has been doing each day, as the encryption changes every 20 hours.

A discussion came in yesterday that is especially concerning. Reeba plays a holograph of  voice waves.

> **Intercept 1** \
> **Voice 1** Commander Pirvee, can you confirm that we will meet Captain Phasma's quota for trainees? \
> **Voice 2 (Commander Pirvee)** We sent recruitment squads to outlying villages, we picked up 40 human younglings that meet the requirements for storm trooper training, they are currently being held in a makeshift camp at Docking Yard 79, you may send a transporter immediately. \
> **Voice 1** We are currently too stretched to spare a transporter, I've sanctioned the services of a local slave trader called Mansar Dred. He'll arrive at Docking Yard 79 in three days, ensure that you cooperate fully, I expect those recruits to start indoctrination within 5 days. Get it done, commander. General Pryde out.

#### Scene 2: Spar House Rock

The PCs travel to the exclusive Spar Club where they must sneak in and steal Mansar Dred's First Order landing FOB, a small token that will identify the PCs ship as one working on behalf of the First Order. However, while the PCs are sneaking into the club, there is a devasting attack by a combined force of local gangsters and First Order shock troopers.

##### Planning

There are a number of things the PCs can learn, as they quickly plan the heist.

**Research**

* Map (See Spar Club map)
* Research can uncover the following extra points: 
 1) The spar is currently in an off season period as the soothing milky waters of the Foza Gan Volcanic streams are not currently at the ideal heat. 
 2) Monitor droids lightly patrol the surrounding forest lands. These patrols are currently not operating at night. It should be possible to sneak into the spar under the cover of night without much risk of being discovered.
 3) While the spar club is currently quiet, the adjacement landing pad and storage buildings appear to be occupied by well armed "muscle".
 4) The Owner of the spar is Bruchon Balgarno, a minor crime boss. This explains why there is a larged number of armed heavies based next to the club.

Glokan suggests that the safest strategy is to dress in white gowns that will give the impression of being members of the club's staff. Or dress as guests. Either way, weapons are prohibited in the club, so either go unarmed with small concealed weapons.

##### Straight into hot water

The PCs should plan their approach and then play it out. There's a complication, though. At the time that the PCs are planning to steal the fob, the club is attacked by an army of gang soliders, backed up by a small ground of first order shock troops. Golden Fang, the world's biggest crime family has made a pact with the First Order, where the minor crime families are destroyed. 

The spar owner, Bruchon Balgarno, a minor crime boss is the target for a "decapitation strike", that will begin shortly after the PCs arrive on the scene. The attack force consists of forty gang fighters, backed by a team of six First Order shock troops and a single TIE fighter. Balgarno has a small force of twenty two fighters and armed staff. 


 

### Act Two: The big rescue

#### Scene 1 - Planning

Armed with the First Order Fob, the PCs can now travel to the First Order holding facility to pick up the children.

#### Scene 2 = Things go south

As the rescue goes on, another ship arrives carrying an escaped Mansar Dred who protests that he is Mansar Dred and that his ID was stolen. Things get fraught, do the PCs continue to claim the identity?

...Possibly Reeba sends a transmission to the base alerting them to the presence of a conman who has been trying to pass himself off as the slaver Mansar Dred. This muddies the water enough for suspicion to fall on Dred, giving the PCs a chance to make a quick exit.
