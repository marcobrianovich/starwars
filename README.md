It's time to open the old lacquered trunk and dust off the mysterious patriarchal heirloom. My sons (aged seven and five) are now both huge Star Wars fans. I'm desperately trying to find activities that drags them away froms screens. Tabletop role-playing games come to mind. I was an avid RPGer, back in the day, I played a fair amount of Star Wars and still have copies of Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game (1st and 2nd editions) from West End Games. I'm thinking that the first edition might suit our needs, it's simpler more straight forward than any of the later systems, although certainly less refined. It was the edition that recently resurrected.

## Resistance Campaign

I asked the boys which era they'd like to adventure in. They both said they preferred the latest trilogy, which makes sense as these are the films that had the greatest impactful on them and, I think, better match the sensibilities of younger audiances. 

So the campaign is set in the aftermath of the First Order strike on Hosnian Prime. With both the New Republic capital and defense fleet destroyed the galaxy is plunged into chaos, the First Order then sends out its Restoration Fleet, in order to subjigate the important core systems and claim control over the whole galaxy.

While the resistance, under General Leia Organa remains the First Order's main target, there are others around the galaxy who would also take a stand against the First Order, hiding in the shadows, striking when they can.
