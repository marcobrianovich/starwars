## Star Wars Roleplaying Game: Resistance Campaign

This introductory campaign to Star Wars Roleplaying Game is set between Star Wars: The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi, following on from the destruction of Hosnian Prime and the fall of the New Republic.

At this time, the First Order, under Supreme Leader Snoke, launches its fleet on a mission of galactic domination. With the New Republic's government and most of its defense fleet destroyed, there is little to stop the First Order fleet from occupying and controlling any Star System. It is, however, a big galaxy. The fleet can't be everywhere at once, and given its ultimate weapon Starkiller Base has been destroyed, the First Order cannot gain complete control. 

A few core star systems, such as Coruscant, go into full revolt, forcing the First Order to dedicate its command ships, such as Snoke's own flagship, to blockade these systems. Although this handful of systems hold back the First Order's fleet, they are isolated from each other, leaving General Leia's Resistance as the only force capable of taking the offensive to the First Order.


### Sector 71

The campaign takes place in Sector 71, which is on the outskirts of the core. The PCs are at the local starport when news comes in that two First Order Star Cruisers have arrived in system. Most independent starships try to leave but are quickly intercepted and impounded. 

The PCs form a party of people who have decided to join the Resistance. Initially, they have no contacts in the Resistance and must fight on their own. As the campaign progresses, their actions come to the attention of General Organa, who will provide limited assistance in return for their completing missions.

### The Party

Over the course of 2 weeks The First Order installs its personel in the local government, co-opting the planetary security force.
